# James's Mod for Sid Meier's *Civilization III: Complete*

This is a modpack for Civ3: Complete that I put together containing some changes I personally find cool. Not really intended for public use, but if you want to play with it too, then feel free to.

## Changes

### Overview

Compared to vanilla Civ3, this mod:

* Permits plagues (max 1)

    * Portugal
    * Zululand
    * Iroquois
    * Hittites
* Adds the following civs:
    * Austria
    * Mali
    * Lakota
    * Vietnam
* Replaces the following leaders:
    * Bismarck of Germany -> Adolf Hitler
    * Catherine of Russia -> Joseph Stalin
    * Lincoln of America -> Franklin D. Roosevelt
    * Tokugawa of Japan -> Meiji
    * Elizabeth of England -> Winston Churchill
    * Wang Kon of Korea -> Sejong
* Adds the following leaders:
    * Charles V of Austria
    * Mansa Musa of Mali
    * Sitting Bull of the Lakota
    * Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam
* Adds new government form: Fundamentalism
* Adds extra civilization advances:
    * Fundamentalism, which unlocks Fundamentalism as a form of government
    * Milling, Steam Engine, and Vacuum Tubes, which are end-of-era techs you must research to proceed to the next era
    * Nanotechnology, Fusion, Advanced Armor, and Heavy Mechanicals, new Modern Era technologies
* Adds new units:
    * Engineer (Workers get tweaked; see *New Units* section)
    * Atomic Bomb
    * Space Marine
    * Mecha
    * Hussar for Austria
    * Viet Cong for Vietnam
    * Malian Worker for Mali
    * Sunka Wakan for the Lakota
    * Turtle Ship for the Koreans
    * King for the non-vanilla civs to use as their king unit in Regicide mode
* Adds new graphics for ICBMs and Tactical Nukes (they're minor changes)
* "Fixes" the previously unused Tactical Nuke launch animation so it plays upon use
* Changed Frigates & Man-O-Wars to upgrade to Destroyers instead of nothing
* Changed Cavalry, Sipahi, and Cossacks to upgrade to Tanks instead of nothing
* Adds a new civil disorder animation
* And adds some other minor changes that are either not very noteworthy and/or that I've forgotten

Almost all other behaviors are identical to vanilla Civ3. You can consider this modpack a "vanilla-chocolate swirl" - that is, it's vanilla but with something extra; it's not a drastically different experience. If you are looking for a big modpack that really changes up the gameplay or dives in deep into a very specific scenario or something, this is *not* for you.

### New Technologies
* Fundamentalism
    * Unlocks the Fundamentalism government
    * Has Theology as a prerequisite
* Nanotechnology
    * Now the tech requirement for SS Exterior Casing
    * Has Synthetic Fibers and Superconductor as prerequisites
    * Is prerequisite for Advanced Armor

    * Now the tech requirement for SS Fuel Cells and SS Engine
    * Has The Laser as a prerequisite

* Advanced Armor
    * Unlocks the Space Marine unit
    * Has Nanotechnology and Smart Weapons as prerequisites

    * Unlocks the Mecha unit
    * Has Fusion, Robotics, and Smart Weapons as prerequisites
* Milling, Steam Engine, and Vacuum Tubes
    * End-of-era technologies for the Ancient, Medieval, and Industrial Eras, respectively. See next section for more info.

### End-of-Era Technologies

The Ancient, Medieval, and Industrial Eras all have one final tech to research before moving onto the next era. They were added to serve two purposes:

* Make it easy to see when era advancement will happen (not that it was difficult to begin with, but having one ultimate tech makes a bit more simple)
* Making era advancements make a little more "sense"; e.g. the Medieval Era's end-of-era tech is the steam engine, an invention which set off the huge societal shift that came about with the Industrial Revolution in real history

End-of-Era techs are more expensive than any single preceding tech from the same era, but not as expensive as the beginning techs of the next era, so they should not pose too much of a hassle to research, but will still likely have a noticeable cost.

### New Government: Fundamentalism

Brings back the Fundamentalism government from Civ2... but mostly just the concept of it existing. I tried to give it some unique traits to offer a new player experience, but I also didn't want to make it too overpowered like the Civ2 Fundamentalism was. I'm no Civ3 guru, so don't be surprised if this is even a little unbalanced.

* Worker Efficiency: 100%
* Hurry Method: Forced Labor
* Corruption: Problematic
* Military Police Cap: 4
* Unit Support: 2/5/8
* Draft Limit: 2
* Xenophobic (population of city must have a majority of your nationality before it can grow)
* Forced Resettlement (population in cities decrease when switching to this government, like how Fascism does)
* Despotism Penalty (Any tile producing more than 2 food, shields, or commerce produces 1 less)
* No maintenance payments on improvements
* Spending rate limited to 50%
    * This means you cannot allocate more than 50% of your revenue to science research in the Domestic Advisor screen, for example.
* Veteran spies (like Communism and Fascism)
* Immune to foreign propaganda (like Democracy)
* Requires completing the Fundamentalism tech (which requires Theology)

## Installation

### Requirements

If you're using this mod with *Civilization III: Complete* (on Steam or other retailers), you're good to go. If for some reason you're not, you need both *Play the World* and *Conquests*, since this mod uses the `BIQ` format from *Conquests* and has units and civilizations found across both expansions.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository or [download the latest release](https://github.com/1230james/civ3-mod/releases).
2. Copy both `James's Mod.biq` and `James's Mod` (the folder) to `(Civ3 root)/Conquests/Conquests`.

To play with this mod, start up Civ3, select `Conquests!` from the main menu, then select `James's Mod.biq`.
