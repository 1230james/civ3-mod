;
; INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRANSLATORS!
;
; 1) These files must not be saved in "Microsoft Word Format", or they will
;    be ruined. They MUST be saved in "Text Only" format.
;
; 2) Please do not insert extra blank lines, nor remove existing blank
;    lines, as this will cause the program to malfunction.
;
; 3) But it is normally okay to turn a long line into two shorter lines;
;    for instance:
;
;    This is a very long sentence; it probably won't fit on one line in German.
;
;                       is equivalent to:
;
;    This is a very long sentence; It probably
;    won't fit on one line in German.
;
; 4) It is also okay to have lines be pretty much as long as they need
;    to be off the edge of the screen (up to, say, 150-200 characters
;    long.
;
; 5) Lines beginning with "#" are control lines, and the FIRST WORD
;    immediately following the # should NOT be translated. Subsequent
;    words on the line SHOULD be translated. For example:
;
;    #caption Hello
;         to
;    #caption Bonjour
;
;    #button Yes
;         to
;    #button Oui
;
; 6) The "{" and "}" characters are used to indicate text which should
;    be displayed in BOLD type. The "[" and "]" characters indicate
;    text which should be displayed in ITALIC type. A {} sequence or
;    a [] sequence can begin and end on different lines.
;
; 7) Lines beginning with "^" begin on new lines.
;
; 8) Lines beginning with "^^" are centered.
;
; 9) The "$" character indicates a string is to be substituted. The
;    $ is followed by the name and ID of the string, as in:
;
;    Greetings, $PLAYERNAME1.
;
;    In this case, the ID of the string is 1. The name of the string
;    is for informational purposes only, so $PLAYERNAME1, $NAME1,
;    $STRING1, and $WHOZIT1 are all equivalent. The names themselves
;    do NOT need to be translated, although translating them won't
;    cause harm as long as the numerical ID is left alone (except in
;    the case below).
;
;    An important EXCEPTION is that $NUM0 (or $NUM1, $NUM2, etc)
;    indicate a numerical value is to be displayed, and $HEX0 $HEX1,
;    etc indicate a hexadecimal value will be displayed. "NUM" and
;    "HEX" must NOT be translated or their special meaning will be lost.
;
;    Other exceptions are $LINK0, $LINK1, etc., $DROPDOWN0, $DROPDOWN1, etc.,
;    $DROPLINK0, $DROPLINK1, etc. These must NOT be translated or their
;    special meaning will be lost.
;
; 10) Sequences enclosed in < > angle brackets are used to perform
;     gender and plurality substitutions.
;
;     $<...> sequences must BEGIN AND END ON THE SAME LINE!
;
;     Here are the substitution forms, followed by some examples:
;
; $FACTION3          = Substitute string 3
; $<3:has:have>      = Substitute based on plurality of string 3
; $<3:le:la:les:les> = Substitute based on plurality & gender of string 3
; $<3:masc:fem:neut:pmasc:pfem:pneut> = plurality & gender, includes neuter
; $<3:$FACTIONADJ4>  = Inserts string 4 and parses based on
;                      plurality & gender of string 3.
; $<M1:$FACTIONADJ4> = Inserts string 4 and parses for the
;                      masculine singular form.
; $<F2:$FACTIONADJ4> = ...Feminine plural, etc.
;
; Since English doesn't have the masculine/feminine
; problem, and no plural problem for "the", there will be cases where
; YOU THE TRANSLATOR will have to add sequences of this type. For
; example, you can convert the following sentences (For "faction",
; imagine substituting any of "Barbarians", "The Roman Empire", etc)
;
; The $FACTION4 $<4:has:have> ...
;
; into:
;
; $<4:Le:La:Les:Les> $FACTION4 $<4:a:ont> ...
;
; and convert...
;
; $TITLE0 $NAME1 of the $FACTION2
;
; into:
;
; $TITLE0 $NAME1 $<2:du:de la:des:des> $FACTION2
;
; Note that the "4:" or "2:" is important as it tells the computer which word
; in the sentence to take its gender/plurality from (there are often
; several substitutions in a paragraph).
;
; FRENCH translators note that the program will AUTOMATICALLY handle
; the L' and D' contractions for le, la, and de.
;
; 11. English also doesn't have adjective gender/plurality
; issues (rah rah English!) which means you'll need to correct
; those as you go along. There are two basic situations you'll
; encounter. The first is adjectives present in the text and
; used to modify words being substituted in:
;
; the pretty $ITEM3 that $NAME4 ...
;
; which you can convert to:
;
; $<3:le:la:les:les> $ITEM3 $<3:bel:belle:bels:belles> que $NAME4 ...
;
; Again the "3:" reminds the computer to substitute based on the
; plurality and gender of $ITEM3 rather than (for instance) $NAME4.
;
; The other situation you'll encounter is where an ADJECTIVE is being
; substituted in to modify words present in the text:
;
; $<M1:$FACTIONADJ0> sisters ...
;
; The "M1" calls for a masculine singular substitution (remember,
; English doesn't have this problem so I've set everything to the
; default). Obviously "sisters" is neither masculine nor singular,
; so you'll want to call for the feminine plural form:
;
; soeurs $<F2:$FACTIONADJ0> ...
;
; 12. GERMAN translators can do the same thing, and simply use
;     $<...> sequences with SIX items to take care of neuter forms.
;     Unfortunately I don't know any German at all, so I can't give
;     you any good examples.

#comment ______________________________________________________________TECH BLURBS


#SCIENCEADVICETECH0
Ah yes, {Bronze Working.} We could make bronze-tipped spears and build gigantic bronze statues.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH1
With {Masonry} we can build walls and large monuments.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH2
If we had an {Alphabet} we could learn to write, record our history and stories, and that would be good.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH3
If we learned to make {Pottery}, we could store food for the future or for long trips. 


#SCIENCEADVICETECH4
Making things roll around would be cool. If we designed the {Wheel}, we could do that. If we get enough horses, we can let them pull us around in Chariots.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH5
Developing {Warrior Code} may lead to better military units, like, say, Archers.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH6
We should think about {Ceremonial Burial}. I mean, who knows what happens after death... the people need stability and Gods to worship.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH7
Our bronze workers are experimenting with iron. If they master {Iron Working} we will make harder, more lethal weapons. But we'll need a source of {Iron ore.}


#SCIENCEADVICETECH8
Oh, {Writing} opens up lots of possibilities. We could establish embassies in other countries and sign written agreements of value to us... 

#SCIENCEADVICETECH9
Our ceremonial practices have opened an area of {Mysticism}. Many of our Shaman think they could build an "Oracle" of great power. That might be cool...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH10
Our wisemen believe they can use our alphabet to develop {Mathematics}, a new way of describing our world. 


#SCIENCEADVICETECH11
Some of our writers are trying to explain the existence of the cosmos and wish to develop a {"Philosophy."} 


#SCIENCEADVICETECH12
Other writers would like to create a {Code of Law} to help govern our people... Sounds good.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH13
Our people are creating a {Literature} that we should store in Libraries as an everlasting testament to our Civilization... Don't you agree?


#SCIENCEADVICETECH14
Now that we can store food for long journeys and write, let's explore the world and draw maps. We can learn to navigate the seas with {Map Making}.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH15
Maybe we can [ride] the horses! {Horseback Riding} could give us a leg-up -- we could mount some warriors if we can get the horses...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH16
Our mystics think there may be many gods and want to explore {Polytheism}... Who knows... 


#SCIENCEADVICETECH17
Our mathematicians propose we develop {Currency} to better manage our commerce. 


#SCIENCEADVICETECH18
Our Philosophers and Lawyers are beginning to describe a new system of government, the {Republic}, that involves representatives of "the people."


#SCIENCEADVICETECH19
Our warriors and mystic priests envision a government ruled by you, sire, and sanctioned by the Gods. {Monarchy:} it's good to be the King.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH20
Given our knowledge of masonry, iron, and mathematics, we can undertake even greater {Construction} projects: Aqueducts, fortifications, and colosseums.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH21
Our priests believe there may be one God that rules all. {Monotheism} could be a very powerful idea leading to significant cultural accomplishments.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH22
{Feudalism} will give us armored Pikemen, but we must have Iron to build 'em.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH23
Some of our construction experts are studying {Engineering,} which will allow us to bridge rivers and plant forests.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH24
Our Holy men are aware of the many faces of God and are trying to find the truth about his nature and power. They call it {"Theology"} and it has great cultural power.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH25
Some of our new armored soldiers are developing warfare into an art -- a way of life really. {Chivalry} may be a dead end, but we'll get knights...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH26
Our Engineers are discovering ways to use materials and techniques to solve many problems. {Invention} will lead to a culture of scientific creativity.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH27
We need a way to communicate ideas to a lot of people all at once. The {Printing Press} might be the way to spread new ideas, fast.

#SCIENCEADVICETECH28
Our educated musicians now notate their music and could develop {Music Theory} -- systems of musical composition to create works of astounding beauty...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH29
Our wise theological scholars want to open Universities to help "educate" our people in our way of life. {Education} will open up many options for our developing Civilization...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH30
Our inventors are trying to harness the power of fire for our weapons. Using {Gunpowder,} soldiers will conquer! But we'll need a supply of Saltpeter...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH31
Our educators are promoting the idea of saving, loaning, and investing wealth. {Banking} our money, and building banks for the people, is culturally and economically smart, they say.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH32
Our wise men are beginning to codify patterns in the stars and explain how they relate to us. This new science, {Astronomy,} holds great promise especially in sea Navigation.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH33
The success of gunpowder is leading to interest in other compounds. Our wise men want to explore {Chemistry} thoroughly... who knows, might be good...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH34
The new printing press is spreading some wild ideas. There is a concept, {Democracy,} for example, in which "the people" attempt to govern themselves. Go figure...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH35
Now that we have a banking system, it is important that our wise men study how our economy is working. They propose to study {Economics.}


#SCIENCEADVICETECH36
Our astronomers would like to formalize a system of Oceanic {Navigation.} It's a good idea, sire. We could explore the world!


#SCIENCEADVICETECH37
Our mathematicians, chemists, and astronomers are working together to figure out how everything in the physical world works. {Physics} will open new areas of research.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH38
Our metal workers could develop their craft of combining ores even farther. {Metallurgy} can bring great benefits in heavy weapons and fortifications.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH39
Our artists should be working for themselves and creating works that are the envy of the world. Our society is now able to support {Free Artistry.}


#SCIENCEADVICETECH40

#SCIENCEADVICETECH42
Our Generals want a {Military Tradition}. They say it could lead to better soldiers and leaders.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH43
A growing feeling that we are "a great nation" is sweeping our cities. This {Nationalism} can lead to significant unity and strength, providing pride and common purpose.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH44
Some inventors and scientists are trying to use steam engines to create a new transportation system called {Railroads}, which could move us great distances.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH45
We could discover why people get sick and how to help them get well. {Medicine} will lead to great things.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH46
Some of our people decry the plight of workers in our society. A new Government system called {Communism} seeks to equalize distribution of wealth.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH47
The steam engine and other machines are changing our society dramatically. Our Scientists and entrepreneurs want {Industrialization} to increase our production.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH48
A very exciting prospect, sir. Our scientists and inventors believe they can harness the power of lightning! Using steam engines and magnets they can produce {Electricity!}


#SCIENCEADVICETECH49
We propose a systematic approach to the discovery of knowledge. The {Scientific Method} involves hypothesis and experimentation. Believe me, it's a good idea.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH50
We are sick (literally) and tired of the smelly mess around here. Let us develop methods for maintaining {Sanitation.} Our cities will grow larger if we do.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH51
It is more important than ever to keep a close watch on our enemies. We've been betrayed too many times. Let's develop an {Espionage} service to protect our way of life.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH52
Increasingly, our business IS business. {The Corporation} will protect our entrepreneurs from liabilities and encourage growth of our economy..


#SCIENCEADVICETECH53
Some of our corporations are learning to {Refine} raw materials on a large scale and transform them into useful products. 


#SCIENCEADVICETECH54
We should develop a new ultra-strong metal alloy, let's call it {Steel}. This could change the way we approach construction.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH55
By using the scientific method, we are on the verge of defining the {Atomic Theory} which explains the very essence of matter. Wow!


#SCIENCEADVICETECH56
Our clever inventors are working on a {Combustion} engine to harness the power of fire. This will allow fast transportation of large vessels.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH57
Here's a clever idea: Let's build our machines with standardized, {Replaceable Parts} so we don't have to trash the thing if it breaks. It's a big idea!


#SCIENCEADVICETECH58
OK, our inventors think they could build flying machines. {Flight} will change our world forever...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH59
Our generals envision a new approach to war in which our soldiers attack from the sea! {Amphibious Warfare} will make all our enemies nervous!


#SCIENCEADVICETECH60
With our replaceable parts, we could develop a new system of {Mass Production}, allowing us to speed up production of machines..


#SCIENCEADVICETECH61
The {Radio} will enable communication in real-time across vast distances. What could be better?


#SCIENCEADVICETECH62
Our engineers could develop {Motorized Transportation}, allowing us to build small, self-propelled vehicles.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH63
Researching {Advanced Flight} is imperative, sir. Imagine: hovering aircraft, our soldiers attacking from the sky... cool or what?


#SCIENCEADVICETECH64
With {Rocketry} we could send objects into space... this will also allow us to create missiles and Jets...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH65
Our physicists are exploring the atom in detail and believe it contains untold energy. {Fission} could be good for war and peace.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH66
We could develop {Computers} that allow light speed information processing. We could have better, "smarter" weapons and faster research...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH67
We must take care of our environment. {Recycling} our waste products will go a long way.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH68
Our scientists say we can safely launch manned {Space Flights}, which could lead to, I dunno, Alpha Centauri?


#SCIENCEADVICETECH69
The benefits of fission have proved to be vast. Our scientists can harness this {Nuclear Power} and make it safe enough for powerplants, and lethal enough for weapons of mass destruction.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH70
We could build a {Superconductor} to further our research into the inner workings of matter. This will help our efforts in our space program.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH71
Working with new materials and computers we could develop {Miniaturization} which will lead to almost magical advances in the future..


#SCIENCEADVICETECH72
A smart approach to {Ecology} will help with our pollution problems and bring other domestic benefits as well.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH73
Our work in recycling has led us to {Synthetic Fibers} with properties only dreamed of a few years ago. We should explore this more deeply.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH74
Our space program continues to create benefits. We could develop {Satellites} to monitor the planet and to enhance communications.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH75
We could develop a new technology, {Lasers}. It involves using highly-focused light and has vast potential for many practical applications.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH76
Our doctors are looking into the very essence of life. With an understanding of {Genetics} we could destroy many deadly diseases and extend life.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH77
Combining what we know of Physics and synthetic fibers we can develop {Stealth}, making our aircraft virtually invisible.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH78
Using laser guidance, miniature computers, and satellites, we can build {Smart Weapons} that can carry out precision bombing missions. Shall we?


#SCIENCEADVICETECH79
With all we know of computers, lasers, and miniaturization, we could build {Robots} to do dangerous work faster and more accurately.


#SCIENCEADVICETECH80
We are now capable of building a computerized, comprehensive {Integrated Defense} system. Maybe we could build a shield against enemy missiles... should we try?


#SCIENCEADVICETECH81
What if we tack some iron plates on the sides of our wooden warships, then we'd have {Ironclads.}


#SCIENCEADVICETECH82
If we're going to war, then there's nothing like a little {Fascism} to bring victory to the troops. 


#SCIENCEADVICETECH83
We have come up with a Government system revolving completely around religion called {Fundamentalism.} However, our wisemen say that the religious stigma will slow down scientific endeavors...


#SCIENCEADVICETECH84
